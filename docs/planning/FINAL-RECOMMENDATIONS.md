### Option 2: Get Router Password (Best Long-term)

**Why this is best:**
- ✅ Free forever
- ✅ No mods needed
- ✅ No installation for friends
- ✅ Permanent and reliable
- ✅ Works with vanilla server

**How to get password:**
1. **Ask router owner** nicely
   - Explain you need it for gaming
   - Offer to change it back after

2. **Check router sticker**
   - Default password might be there
   - Try: `admin`, `password`, `1234`

3. **Reset router** (if you have physical access)
   - Find reset button (small hole)
   - Hold 10-30 seconds
   - Default password on sticker
   - **Warning:** Resets WiFi password too!

**Once you have access:**
- Set up port forwarding (see `PORT-FORWARDING-GUIDE.md`)
- Share: `YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:25565`
- Done!

### Option 3: Local Network (Works Now!)

**For friends on same WiFi:**

- **Address:** `192.168.1.8:25565`
