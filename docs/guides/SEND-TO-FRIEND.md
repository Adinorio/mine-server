## Which File Should You Send?

**Send `FIX-FRIEND-FIREWALL.bat`** - It's the easiest:
- ✅ Just double-click after right-clicking "Run as administrator"
- ✅ Works for most people
- ✅ Shows clear messages
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully

---

## What the Script Does

1. Checks if running as Administrator (needed for firewall changes)
2. Removes any old/conflicting firewall rules
3. Finds Java installations on their computer
4. Adds firewall rules to allow Minecraft/Java to connect outbound
5. Creates a general rule to allow outbound connections

**It's safe** - it only allows outbound connections, doesn't open any ports for incoming connections.

## After Your Friend Runs It

**Tell them:**
- If it still doesn't work, they may also need to:
  - Check antivirus settings (add Minecraft/Java to exceptions)
  - Disable VPN if using one
  - Try from a different network (mobile hotspot)

**If it works:**
- They're all set! No need to do anything else.
