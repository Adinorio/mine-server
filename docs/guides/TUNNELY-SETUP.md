# Tunnely Setup Guide for Minecraft Server

## Important: Use Regular Tunnely (NOT P2P)

**Tunnely P2P requires port forwarding** - which you don't have access to.

**Regular Tunnely** works without port forwarding - perfect for you!

---

## Step 1: Download Regular Tunnely

1. Go to: https://tunnely.org/
2. **Download the REGULAR version** (not P2P)
3. Look for "Download" or "Get Started" button
4. Download for Windows

---

## Step 2: Install Tunnely

1. Run the installer
2. Follow the installation wizard
3. Install on **your laptop only** (friends don't need it!)

---

## Step 3: Set Up Your Server in Tunnely

1. **Open Tunnely application**
2. **Create a new server** or "Add Server"
3. **Point it to your Minecraft server:**
   - Local address: `localhost:25565`
   - Or: `127.0.0.1:25565`
4. **Tunnely will generate a connection URL**

---

## Step 4: Get Connection URL

Tunnely will show you a URL like:
- `tunnely.org/abc123` or
- `your-server.tunnely.org`

**This is what friends use to connect!**

## Step 5: Friends Connect

Friends just need to:
1. Open TLauncher
2. Select version 1.21.11
3. Multiplayer → Direct Connect
4. Enter the Tunnely URL

## Alternative: Try playit.gg Again First

Since you already have playit.gg set up, you might want to try it again:

1. Restart playit.gg completely
2. Recreate the tunnel
3. Use IP address: `147.185.221.24:PORT`
4. Might work better now!

**Tunnely is a good backup if playit.gg still doesn't work.**

---

## Quick Start

1. Download regular Tunnely from: https://tunnely.org/
2. Install on your laptop
3. Point to `localhost:25565`
4. Share the URL with friends
5. Done!

**Much easier than P2P version!**
