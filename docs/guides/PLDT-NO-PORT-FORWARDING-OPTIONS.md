# PLDT Router - No Port Forwarding Available

## The Problem
Your PLDT router doesn't show "NAT" or "Virtual Server" options. This means:
- Port forwarding might be disabled by PLDT
- It might require admin access you don't have
- Some PLDT routers don't support it

## Solutions (No Router Access Needed)

### Option 1: Try playit.gg Again ⭐ BEST OPTION

**You already have this set up - try it again!**

**Steps:**
1. Make sure server is running: `.\start-server.ps1`
2. Completely restart playit.gg
3. Recreate tunnel in dashboard
4. Use **IP address** (not domain): `147.185.221.24:PORT`
5. Friends connect - no router needed!

**This is your best bet since you already have it!**

### Option 2: Contact PLDT Support

**Ask them to enable port forwarding:**

1. **Call PLDT support:** 171 (from PLDT landline) or check their website
2. **Ask:** "Can you enable port forwarding for port 25565?"
3. **Explain:** You need it for gaming
4. **They might:**
   - Enable it remotely
   - Give you admin access
   - Or say it's not available

**Worth a try!**

### Option 3: Use Local Network (Works Now!)

**For friends on same WiFi:**

- **Address:** `192.168.1.6:25565` (your current IP)
- **No setup needed**
- **Already works!**

**Limitation:** Only works on same WiFi

---

### Option 4: Mobile Hotspot (Temporary)

**If you have mobile data:**

1. **Turn on hotspot** on your phone
2. **Connect laptop** to hotspot
3. **Friends connect** to hotspot
4. **Use local IP** (like `192.168.43.1:25565`)
5. **Works without router!**

---

### Option 5: Check Router Model

**Some PLDT routers have different interfaces:**

1. **Check router model** (usually on sticker)
2. **Search online:** "[Your Router Model] port forwarding"
3. **Might have different menu** or require different access

## My Recommendation

### Try This Order:

1. **Try playit.gg again** (5 minutes)
   - Restart everything
   - Use IP address
   - Might work this time!

2. **Use local network** for same WiFi friends
   - `192.168.1.6:25565`
   - Already works!

3. **Call PLDT support** (if you want permanent solution)
   - Ask them to enable port forwarding
   - Might work!

## Why PLDT Routers Are Tricky

- Some PLDT routers have port forwarding **disabled by default**
- Some require **special admin access** from PLDT
- Some **don't support it at all**
- PLDT may restrict it for security

**This is why playit.gg or other tunneling services are useful!**

## Quick Action Plan

**Right Now:**
1. Try playit.gg again with IP address
2. Use local network for same WiFi friends

**If You Want Permanent:**
1. Call PLDT support
2. Ask about port forwarding
3. They might enable it
