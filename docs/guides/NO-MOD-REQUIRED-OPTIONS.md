# Options That Don't Require Mods

If Tunnely requires a mod, here are alternatives that work with vanilla servers:

## Option 1: playit.gg (No Mods Needed) ⭐

**Works with vanilla Minecraft server - no mods!**

### Try again:
1. **Restart playit.gg** completely
2. **Recreate tunnel** in dashboard
3. **Use IP address:** `147.185.221.24:PORT`
4. **Friends connect** - no mods needed!

**This is your best bet - already set up, no mods required!**

## Option 2: Get Router Password (Best Solution)

**Once you have router access, port forwarding is perfect!**

### Ways to get password:
1. **Ask router owner** nicely
2. **Check router sticker** for default password
3. **Reset router** (if you have physical access)
   - Hold reset button 10-30 seconds
   - Default password on sticker

### Then:
- Set up port forwarding (see `PORT-FORWARDING-GUIDE.md`)
- Works with vanilla server
- No mods, no software for friends
- Permanent and reliable

## Option 3: Use Local Network (Works Now!)

**For friends on same WiFi:**

- **Address:** `192.168.1.8:25565`
- **No mods needed**
- **No setup needed**
- **Already works!**

**Limitation:** Only works on same WiFi

---

## Option 4: Mobile Hotspot (Temporary)

**If you have mobile data:**

1. **Turn on hotspot** on phone
2. **Connect laptop** to hotspot
3. **Friends connect** to hotspot
4. **Use local IP** (like `192.168.43.1:25565`)
5. **No mods needed!**

---

## Option 5: Ask for Router Password Nicely

**If it's a family/shared router:**

- Explain you need it for gaming with friends
- Offer to change it back after
- Or ask them to set up port forwarding for you
- Most people are understanding!

## My Recommendation

### Try playit.gg again first:
- No mods needed
- Already set up
- No installation for friends
- Might work better now

### If playit.gg fails:
- **Get router password** (best long-term)
- Or use **local network** for same WiFi friends

## Why Avoid Mods?

If Tunnely requires a mod:
- ⚠️ Need to install mod on server
- ⚠️ Friends might need mod too
- ⚠️ More complicated setup
- ⚠️ Compatibility issues

**playit.gg and port forwarding work with vanilla servers - much simpler!**
